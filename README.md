# Battleship

### Reflection Notes
**1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.**

> Without having an Interaction Pattern to work from, we created our own high-level design using comments where needed.  This was slightly higher level than pseudocode.  From there, we worked through the comments and created our code to satisfy each one

**2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?**

> One more day would have allowed us to complete Iteration 4.  But, we wanted a nice holiday weekend so we made that sacrifice.

**3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.**

> We used Driver/Navigator for the entire development process.  This worked well for us since we had enough flexibility in our schedules.

**4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.**

> As with Driver/Navigator, we were worked together for the entire project and used Slack to communicate between sessions.
